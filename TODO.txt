List of requested changes:
--------------------------

- allow analysis to continue after spike removal causes a "square root error"

- Save pixels with residual spikes to output file

- restore analysis windows to previous state after processing a spectrum with a spike

- use OMI pixel quality flags when reading data

- improve spike removal (also remove pixel before & after spike?)

- improve plots: display (spectrum + offset) vs reference

- improve plots: don't plot gaps
